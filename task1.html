        <h1 style="color: rgb(251, 17, 235);">Rocking Star Yash</h1>
    </center>
    <p style="color:darkmagenta;">Naveen Kumar Gowda (born 8 January 1986), known by his screen name Yash,
        is an
        Indian actor who predominantly
        works in Kannada films. He is a recipient of three Filmfare Awards South and two SIIMA awards.

        Yash began his career with appearances in several television series in the 2000s. He made his film debut in
        2007
        with Jambada Hudugi. The 2008 romantic drama Moggina Manasu, for which he received the Filmfare Award for
        Best
        Supporting Actor, proved to be a breakthrough role for Yash. His first film in a leading role, Rocky (2008),
        was
        poorly received by critics and a box office flop. Yash went on to establish himself as a leading actor of
        Kannada cinema with the college romance Googly (2013), comedy-drama Raja Huli (2013), fantasy action
        Gajakesari
        (2014), romantic comedy Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari (2014), action film Masterpiece (2015) and action romance
        Santhu
        Straight Forward (2016). The pan-India success of Prashanth Neel's period action films K.G.F: Chapter 1
        (2018)
        and K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022), helped Yash attain nationwide recognition. The latter ranks as the
        highest-grossing
        Kannada film.</p>

        <h4 style="color: black;">Narendra Modi</h4>
    </center>
    <p style="color: darkgreen;">Narendra Damodardas Modi[a] (born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician serving
        as the current prime
        minister of India since 26 May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the member
        of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya
        Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the
        longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.

        Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was
        introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he
        abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi
        became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose
        through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998. In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister
        of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the
        2002 Gujarat riots, and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official records,
        a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000
        deaths, mostly Muslim. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no
        evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister were credited
        for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health,
        poverty and education indices in the state.</p>
